# Angular Playground

## Routing

Switched from GitHub Pages to Google Firebase Hosting, because why not? ðŸ¤” It finally redirects from `root` to the default language's `"/dir"`, so I don't have to dumb stuff to the build's folder structure afterwards...

## Localization

Works like a charm! ðŸ¤“ Known issue: the `wildcard`ed `404` page from other locales redirect to the default language's `404` page. Probably an Angular issue, didn't find anything valuable information regarding this behaviour...

## SEO

Kinda did something that works, so that's a win I guess!
