## Routing

Still not ideal to use GitHub Pages as a deployment service, but the routing works I guess ðŸ˜… (except for switching languages on any other route than `/`, it's just gonna bring You to `root` of the selected language)

## Localization

Works like a charm! ðŸ¤“

## SEO

Kinda did something that works, so that's a win I guess!
